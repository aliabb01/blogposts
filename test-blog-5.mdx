## Test 5

## MDX Example with js code

```javascript
const a = 1 + 4;
console.log(5);
```

This is a simple MDX file that includes a React component.

## Some Markdown Content

```jsx
export function newComponent() {
    return <p>This is a text component within mdx</p>;
}
```

This is the content of my first blog post.
